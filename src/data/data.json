          "talkDescription":"Teams is the fastest growing product of Microsoft. The talk is about how we rewrote the existing Angular+REST based Wiki App into React+Apollo+GraphQL. This is a full stack rewrite of an app at Microsoft’s scale and we have a story to tell. The story which starts from stack selection, goes through deep diving into it while writing the app and figuring out tonnes of stuff along the way which someone would’t find in docs, blogs, tutorials, courses or anywhere. Think about creating the first ever GraphQL backend in Teams, even getting the leadership to agree was a big task. At Microsoft, we don’t run behind anything shiny, we have to prove that this is the best possible solution. Once, we were done with that we had to figure out the entire stack, how would a C#( also, why not NodeJS?) based GraphQL server interact with Apollo based frontend. You don’t get all the benefits which Apollo provides. Even simple things like schema sharing, type generation (yes! the entire frontend is in typescript), error code sharing are things which you have to figure out yourself. There are the challenges of writing any app in any stack which you have to figure out for this one as well, like, schema finalization, iterative growth, code flow, best practices, unit testing at both ends, integration testing, performance measurement and tuning and a lot of other things. Like for performance tuning, we ran internal experiments, went through the entire source code of Apollo. How to use Apollo Client middle-wares to extract common logic out? Query as component or client.query? Multiple questions ensured a lot of us was left on us to figure out. Also, this app is a co-authoring app, so how do you do locking/unlocking without doing subscription? How do you listen to GraphQL at one end and also respond to some of the old REST endpoints. As if that was not enough, there are services dependency on long poll. I am telling you things mount over each other so quick! These are recipes, one will encounter only when one solves such hard problems. This is a story, which I wished someone had told me before I got into leading this effort.",

I am the solo developer at Kidovators (an eduTech startup for kids) and I want to share my story of adapting Apollo/GraphQL in my company. We’re using Redux+REST for our app but the ever growing features in it forced us to re-think our strategy. There are two main reasons any startup scaling in India should adapt Apollo/GraphQL strategy: 1. API calls don’t increase with the number of features. 2. Eliminating over-fetching saves precious data on client. Like for our case, our app is being used by kids from schools in rural areas across India. This was a great motivator to shift to GraphQL.",

Problems were two-fold.</p><h2>First Problem.</h2>          We were doing multiple API calls and fetching extra data not required by mobile as the API is common across the website and mobile. Our first solution was to create another API for PWA client to give less data. We quickly realized it is not scalable and the turnaround time and maintenance effort for creating a separate version of API for PWA was huge.</p><h2>Second Problem.</h2><p>The data received was from different API calls and verbose in nature because of which the client ended up in calculating the derived data required to render fields. For example - the logic to filter and sort the data was implemented on the client which was creating unnecessary overhead on the browser.</p><h2>Solution.</h2><p>GraphQL with Apollo client and Apollo server.</p><p>We created our own GraphQL endpoint whose source of truth will be all the current API’s needed to render hotels. This transformation layer will give the client only that derived data which is required. Not a single thing more or less.</p><p>No manipulation required in client side , all fields given by GraphQL are the formated fields that the client renderer requires.</p><p>The intended audience for this talk is anyone, React specialists or not.</p><p>I’ll start the talk by explaining how GraphQl can make the life of a frontend developer easier by not depending on API versioning system and getting exactly what they need.

          "talkDescription":"Imagine you’ve an application of a Hotel Booking System which is being used by a front desk manager at the Hotel Reception. Now your PM has a requirement and this how the the conversation begins: Manager: Hey, we have a page of Booking Details and we want to keep it up to date in real time. Developer (Immediate response): Can’t the user refresh the page or can’t we refresh the page at certain interval? 🤔 Manager: Eyebrows up and weird look!! 😠 Developer (After scratching his head): since I’ve a GraphQL query for fetching the total number of bookings for a particular hotel I’ll add polling to the query and I’ll be done 🚀  Manager: Awesome go ahead. Developer implements the feature and now comes the time for UAT Manager: This doesn’t really feels real time though! Developer: Okay I’ll change the polling frequency. Manager: Naah still doesn’t feels like real time though! Developer: What to do now 🤦🏻‍♂️!! Already messed up with the codebase. Developer (To Himself): I think subscriptions can solve this? But I’m not sure. I don’t really know what all it will take? Also I don’t know how to make a case and convince my manager that subscriptions are the one shot go for all these use cases. So this talk is about demonstrating what all pieces are required to create a real time application and why do we need all those pieces, so at the end of the day you can go back to work and convince your managers what value subscriptions can bring in to your products.",

Anyone who has used Gatsby has likely used GraphQL because it’s the default way to consume data in Gatsby! Gatsby uses GraphQL in a pretty unique way though. With hundreds of different data sources with different shapes, it is really hard to scale with a type first model. We solve this with type inference in Gatsby. Taking it a step further, we also create connections automatically and generate filters for rich querying! In this talk, we’ll do a deep dive into how Gatsby uses GraphQL. We’ll look at how we do type inference today. We’ll also look at limitations of our current approach and how we’re looking at solving them so that users and plugin authors have a great inference system with solid extension capabilities.

          "talkDescription":"In this talk we’ll walk through our journey to GraphQL at Adobe, and highlight a few of our successes and failures along the way. Use Case: We at Adobe Experience Cloud, wanted to redefine our customer’s experience, and as part of this redesign we wanted to focus on surfacing more data (but not at the cost of a performance overhead). This new redesign now required a mix of data from different sources to be rendered on the screen and we began to face many problems around performance, documentation, and general ease-of-use. On many pages, we found ourselves making four or five round-trips to the server to fetch the data and nit picking it at the client side in order to render it. Solving the problem with GraphQL: After some investigation, we thought of integrating GraphQL to our architecture— we decided to add a GraphQL proxy layer on top of our REST APIs. This was a pretty easy process- we built some utilities around making downstream REST calls to fetch data in our resolver, and wrote up some rules around converting our existing models into GraphQL and within a matter of days were ready to call our GraphQL pilot a success. But the real challenges begin now: One of our REST API rolled back to a previous version and suddenly every GraphQL query started failing. And what about caching? The solution to these problems and others that came across as we switched to GraphQL are covered next.",

Karate was featured as one of the top 5 open-source API testing tools in a blog post on TechBeacon, within just six months of its release. It now regularly turns up in blog-posts, social-media mentions, and believe it or not – even job-listings as a desired skill.</p><p>Karate has clearly filled a gap in the industry for a simple yet powerful tool that makes easy – the business of dealing with complex HTTP payloads.
